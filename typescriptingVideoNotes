-Notoes-

-Typscripting-ability to allow for static typing in js 
-This allows for large scale js app development(allows for checking dic, error during complie time)
-->cool thing is that this compiles all of plain js SO... runs on any browser. any host. any OS!!!

-Typscripting just gives you the code in plain js minus the typscript and so it's no framework or library
-Due to being structural typing as suppose to nominal, if varialbes are indentical with different values but structurally sound it would be ok
-can have callbacks in the t entity for extra fucntions(whats the purpose of this?)
-allows for union types (string or callback function) for the data types 
-How does the typescript know all these defintions before autocompletes?
-->cuz of Lib.dts a declaration file in every compilation
    -these could be written in other frameworks declarations i mean
    -DefinelyTyped on Github has a lot of the declarations each of the js frameworks. 

-Questions-
-What does it mean by structural not nominal as everything in typescripting?
-->   

-So VS code tryings to give and autocompletes code with a list within proptype is typescript?
    -like statement completion with contextual typing
    -->written intellisence and typeahead 

-interface: what does it do? just if the variables and objects are same data types as intended
