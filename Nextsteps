solutions for the 'many props' and 'long prop chain' problems:
1. proptypes (https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)


2. static types for props via TypeScript


3. (on the long prop chain side) use Redux or a similar library (e.g. MobX)


recommendation for next challenge:


1. generate with TypeScript with CRA[Finished]


2. build out the todos app to the level of where it is now
(feel free to leave off edit functionality)[1. input header 2. show todo items]
